# Project Title: Analyzing Video Game Sales and Reviews  
### Introduction  
The global video game market is a multi-billion dollar industry, with projected worth expected to exceed $300 billion by 2027, according to [Mordor Intelligence](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-gaming-market). However, with the vast array of games available, it can be challenging to determine whether the quality of games has improved with the growth of the market.  

This project aims to analyze the top 400 best-selling video games between 1977 and 2020 and compare sales data with critic and user reviews. We will investigate whether video games have improved in quality as the market has expanded.  

### Dataset  
This project is taken with [Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1413). Our dataset consists of two tables, each containing 400 rows. However, a more comprehensive dataset of over 13,000 games is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/holmjason2/videogamedata).  

### Methodology  
We will utilize SQL and various data analysis libraries to extract, clean and visualize the data. We will create various charts and graphs to gain insights into the trends of the video game market.  

### Results  
Our analysis reveals that, despite the growing number of games, the average rating of video games has not significantly improved over time. This suggests that publishers may prioritize profitability over quality.  

### Conclusion  
Our findings indicate that the growth of the gaming market has not necessarily resulted in better quality video games. We hope that our analysis will provide valuable insights for the gaming industry and consumers.
